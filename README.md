# Moments

This is a social network website written using the MERN stack! This was a passion project of mine since I have always wanted to create an app that allows people to connect with each other.

This was built utilizing JavaScript with React.js on the front‑end, an Express.js framework on the back‑end, and MongoDB Atlas to store post and user info. First-time users are prompted to sign-up using an email and password. Profiles are customizable where users can update their profile pictures and about sections. Users can write their own posts and view/like content of others users as well as view other users profiles.
